# Rootin' For You
Rootin’ for you, our website aims to connect volunteers who are ready to cook food and supply it to covid positive patients. It matches
them, based on their distance, and provides a menu containing the dishes that the volunteer can cook, and can be customised to the
patients’ needs.
There are mutiple volunteers ready to prepare food and supply it to the covid patients. The only way that can be done is through
helpline, which already have a lot of traffic. We directly connect the patients and volunteers, making the process time efficient,
organised and hassle-free

# Tech stack:
• Flask – web development
• HTML – structure
• CSS – aesthetics
• Python for the backend
• Sqlite3 for data management
• All open-source libraries


# Novelty:
There are helplines and charitable organisations providing food, but we have automated the process, hence making our website
unique
• Our website is one of its kind, and saves time by automatically assigning requests
• Orders are customisable and adhere to patients’ requests
• Every patients’ request is taken care of, and all orders are fulfilled
• No mediation required, and our website ensures that patients get in direct contact with the volunteer
• We assign orders based on the closest distance
Future scope of this project:
• Pairing with google maps
• Collaboration with NGOs

# Target user:
This website is targeted at helping covid patients get healthy food, customising to their needs, at the comfort of their doorstep, aiding
their recovery process
